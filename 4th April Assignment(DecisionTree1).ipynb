    "# Q1. Describe the decision tree classifier algorithm and how it works to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome. In a Decision tree, there are two nodes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision nodes are used to make any decision and have multiple branches, whereas Leaf nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches. It is called a decision tree because, similar to a tree, it starts with the root node, which expands on further branches and constructs a tree-like structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the decision tree constructed , it can be used to make predictions starting at the root node and following the path down the tree based on the value of feature and assigns the class label associated with the leaf node it reaches. "

    "Mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification is based on two concepts: entropy and information gain. Entropy is a measure of uncertainty or randomness in a dataset. It quantifies how much information is needed to describe the dataset. A high entropy means that the dataset is very diverse and unpredictable, while a low entropy means that the dataset is very homogeneous and predictable. Information gain is a measure of how much entropy is reduced by splitting the dataset according to a feature. It quantifies how much information is gained by performing a test or a decision on a feature. A high information gain means that the feature is very useful for separating the classes, while a low information gain means that the feature is not very useful for separating the classes.\n",

    "- In making decision tree first we have to decide the feature, With the help of \"information gain\" we able to decide which feature to be choose.

    "The geometric intuition behind decision tree classification is that each node in the tree represents a decision rule that splits the data into two or more subsets based on some feature value or threshold. The leaf nodes represent the final class labels for the data points that fall into that region. Geometrical intuition is useful for visualizing the decision boundaries that separate the different classes in the feature space. Each decision node in the tree corresponds to a hyperplane that partitions the feature space into two half-spaces, and the leaf nodes correspond to the regions of the feature space that are assigned to a particular class."

The rows represent the actual classes, while the columns represent the predictions. It is used to determine the performance of the classification models for a given set of test data. \n",

    "In order to accurately assess the performance of a classifier and to make informed decisions based on its predictions, it is crucial to choose an appropriate evaluation metric. In most situations, this choice will highly depend on the specific problem at hand.

On the other hand, if we are building a model to filter spam emails, we may want to focus on precision rather than recall, because we want to minimize the false positives.\n",

This is because it considers the trade-off between true positive rate (sensitivity) and false positive rate (1-specificity) at different thresholds. By adjusting the threshold, we can get a classifier that prioritizes either sensitivity or specificity, depending on the cost of false positives and false negatives of a specific problem."
